# API
v0.1.0
- Create the initial contract or swagger endpoint so for the next endpoints I'll just update them
- Create the import endpoint and update the contract. This endpoint will receive the ofx file and call the transform class.
    Something like: 
    ```
    POST /v1/transactions/import
    - Content-Type: multipart/form-data
    - file: .ofx
    ```

- Create the transform class
    this class will receive the ofx file read it and output the csv with the desired columns
